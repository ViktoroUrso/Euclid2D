Hi, folks.

That me introduce my idea - Euclid2D package. I hope it will be a great package! :-)

This package realize object-oriented "engine" for 2D-geometry objects.

For whom this stuff - 2D-game developers, planymetria task developers and may be someone else.

This package make an hierarchy of objects in Carthesian 2D plane.

The aim of this project - make quick and light decision for manipulation 
with objects in 2D-plane on the base of standart python libraries 
with simple and full pythonic interface for developers.

---------

It's better then Shapely, couse it's no need GEOS
It's better then SIMPY Geometry, couse it hasn't simbolic ?equations?

I'd like to make a simple tool with better feateres of this libs!
