Hi, folks.

That me introduce my idea - EUCLID package. I hope it will be a great library! :-)

This package realize object-oriented "engine" for 2D-geometry objects.

For whom this stuff - 2D-game developers, planymetria task developers and may be someone else.

This package make an hierarchy of objects in EUCLID 2D plane.

The aim of this project - make quick and light decision for manipulation 
with objects in 2D-plane on the base of standart python libraries 
with simple and full interface for developers.

Hi, folks.

That me introduce my idea - EUCLID2D library(module). I hope it will be a great library! :-)

This library realize object-oriented "engine" for 2D-geometry objects.

For whom this stuff - 2D-game developers, planymetria task developers and may be someone else.

This library make an hierarchy of objects in Carthesian plane.

The aim of this project - make quick and light decision for manipulation 
with objects in 2D-plane on the base of standart python libraries 
with simple and full interface for developers.

It's better then Shapely, couse it's no need GEOS
It's better then SIMPY Geometry, couse it hasn't simbolic ?equations?
It's better then ??????, couse ????

I'd like to make a simple tool with better feateres of this libs!
